                          uses of this type are discouraged because of difficulty
                          describing its usage when embedded in APIs. 1. Ignored fields.
                          \ It includes many fields which are not generally honored.
                          \ For instance, ResourceVersion and FieldPath are both very
                          rarely valid in actual usage. 2. Invalid usage help.  It
                          is impossible to add specific help for individual usage.
                          \ In most embedded usages, there are particular restrictions
                          like, \"must refer only to types A and B\" or \"UID not
                          honored\" or \"name must be restricted\". Those cannot be
                          well described when embedded. 3. Inconsistent validation.
                          \ Because the usages are different, the validation rules
                          are different by usage, which makes it hard for users to
                          predict what will happen. 4. The fields are both imprecise
                          and overly precise.  Kind is not a precise mapping to a
                          URL. This can produce ambiguity during interpretation and
                          require a REST mapping.  In most cases, the dependency is
                          on the group,resource tuple and the version of the actual
                          struct is irrelevant. 5. We cannot easily change it.  Because
                          this type is embedded in many locations, updates to this
                          type will affect numerous schemas.  Don't make new APIs
                          embed an underspecified API type they do not control. \n

                          used type that is well-focused on your reference. For example,

                              For example, if the object reference is to a container
                              within a pod, this would take on a value like: "spec.containers{name}"
                              (where "name" refers to the name of the container that

                          uses of this type are discouraged because of difficulty
                          describing its usage when embedded in APIs. 1. Ignored fields.
                          \ It includes many fields which are not generally honored.
                          \ For instance, ResourceVersion and FieldPath are both very
                          rarely valid in actual usage. 2. Invalid usage help.  It
                          is impossible to add specific help for individual usage.
                          \ In most embedded usages, there are particular restrictions
                          like, \"must refer only to types A and B\" or \"UID not
                          honored\" or \"name must be restricted\". Those cannot be
                          well described when embedded. 3. Inconsistent validation.
                          \ Because the usages are different, the validation rules
                          are different by usage, which makes it hard for users to
                          predict what will happen. 4. The fields are both imprecise
                          and overly precise.  Kind is not a precise mapping to a
                          URL. This can produce ambiguity during interpretation and
                          require a REST mapping.  In most cases, the dependency is
                          on the group,resource tuple and the version of the actual
                          struct is irrelevant. 5. We cannot easily change it.  Because
                          this type is embedded in many locations, updates to this
                          type will affect numerous schemas.  Don't make new APIs
                          embed an underspecified API type they do not control. \n

                              For example, if the object reference is to a container
                              within a pod, this would take on a value like: "spec.containers{name}"
                              (where "name" refers to the name of the container that

                          uses of this type are discouraged because of difficulty
                          describing its usage when embedded in APIs. 1. Ignored fields.
                          \ It includes many fields which are not generally honored.
                          \ For instance, ResourceVersion and FieldPath are both very
                          rarely valid in actual usage. 2. Invalid usage help.  It
                          is impossible to add specific help for individual usage.
                          \ In most embedded usages, there are particular restrictions
                          like, \"must refer only to types A and B\" or \"UID not
                          honored\" or \"name must be restricted\". Those cannot be
                          well described when embedded. 3. Inconsistent validation.
                          \ Because the usages are different, the validation rules
                          are different by usage, which makes it hard for users to
                          predict what will happen. 4. The fields are both imprecise
                          and overly precise.  Kind is not a precise mapping to a
                          URL. This can produce ambiguity during interpretation and
                          require a REST mapping.  In most cases, the dependency is
                          on the group,resource tuple and the version of the actual
                          struct is irrelevant. 5. We cannot easily change it.  Because
                          this type is embedded in many locations, updates to this
                          type will affect numerous schemas.  Don't make new APIs
                          embed an underspecified API type they do not control. \n

                          used type that is well-focused on your reference. For example,

                              For example, if the object reference is to a container
                              within a pod, this would take on a value like: "spec.containers{name}"
                              (where "name" refers to the name of the container that

                          uses of this type are discouraged because of difficulty
                          describing its usage when embedded in APIs. 1. Ignored fields.
                          \ It includes many fields which are not generally honored.
                          \ For instance, ResourceVersion and FieldPath are both very
                          rarely valid in actual usage. 2. Invalid usage help.  It
                          is impossible to add specific help for individual usage.
                          \ In most embedded usages, there are particular restrictions
                          like, \"must refer only to types A and B\" or \"UID not
                          honored\" or \"name must be restricted\". Those cannot be
                          well described when embedded. 3. Inconsistent validation.
                          \ Because the usages are different, the validation rules
                          are different by usage, which makes it hard for users to
                          predict what will happen. 4. The fields are both imprecise
                          and overly precise.  Kind is not a precise mapping to a
                          URL. This can produce ambiguity during interpretation and
                          require a REST mapping.  In most cases, the dependency is
                          on the group,resource tuple and the version of the actual
                          struct is irrelevant. 5. We cannot easily change it.  Because
                          this type is embedded in many locations, updates to this
                          type will affect numerous schemas.  Don't make new APIs
                          embed an underspecified API type they do not control. \n

                              For example, if the object reference is to a container
                              within a pod, this would take on a value like: "spec.containers{name}"
                              (where "name" refers to the name of the container that

                                                or can be a variable reference to
                                                a key specified in a ConfigMap (see

                                                `cosign.pub` containing the public
                                                key used for verification, (see https://github.com/sigstore/cosign/blob/main/KMS.md#kubernetes-secret).
                                                When multiple keys are specified each
                                                key is processed as a separate staticKey
                                                entry (.attestors[*].entries.keys)

                                                count is applied across the keys.
